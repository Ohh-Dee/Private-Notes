<h2 id="title">Live Server Preview Issue</h2>

<pre>There was an issue with the live sever plugin while writing HTML/CSS code where the sever had issues giving live updates due to the folder name having a " " space 
and a & symbol. 
</pre>

     This issue could not be fixed by simply renaming the file with a right click in VSCode or in file explorer so I turned to use Git Bash in order to update it without running into errors.

<pre>
     Opening the Gitbash terminal I verified that I was in the correct folder path then used the "mv "HTML & CSS" HTML-CSS" command in order to highlight the folder I wanted to change first
with the " " symbols then a space followed by what I wanted to rename the folders to. This is treated as a delete and add following this I used add and push commit commands in order to save
these changes and get them staged ready for a push.

<pre>    Following these changes the live sever viewer worked as it intended. This situation shows how one can overwrite a folder file that is interuppting production by using GitBash as 
a bypass when windows and VS Code would not allow the modifcation of the folder.
