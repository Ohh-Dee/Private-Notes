Invisible
Invisible
Invisible
Invisible
walking by the wall

(Shy one) the shadows will not fall
(Shy one) is silently ignored
(Quiet one) discouraged by the noise
(Quiet one) living without choice
(Quiet one) is a life without a voice

When you can't even say my name
Has the memory gone? Are you feeling numb?
Go on, call my name
I can't play this game, so I ask again
Will you say my name?
Has the memory gone? Are you feeling numb?
Or have I become invisible?

the dreamers wish away
(Hindsight) it's falling on my face
(Highlights) the shape of my disgrace

When you don't hear a word I say
As the talking goes, it's a one-way flow
No fault, no blame
Has the memory gone? Are you feelin' numb?
And have I become invisible?

Invisible
Invisible
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible
Invisible

No one hears a word they say
Has the memory gone? Are you feelin' numb?
Not a word they say
But a voiceless crowd isn't backin' down
When the air turns red
With a loaded hesitation
Can you say my name?
Has the memory gone? Are you feelin' numb?
Have we all become invisible?
