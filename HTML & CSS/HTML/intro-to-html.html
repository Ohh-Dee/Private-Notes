    <head><!-- contains information about webpage-->
        <title>My first website</title>
    </head>
    <body><!--Contains visable content on your webpage-->
        <h1>This is an h1 heading</h1>
        <h2>This is an h2 heading</h2>
        <h3>This is an h3 Heading</h3>
        <!---Used for Titles or large text-->
        <p> This is a paragraph which can be used to fill in a 
            body of text.<br>Using the br with tags will put a line break.<br>
            Including another paragraph tag will also make a line break.
        </p>
        <hr><!---Adds a horrazontal line across the whole page-->
        <pre>
            Now using the pre open and /pre closing tags will create pre formated text.
            This works differently than p tags as it will take spaces and breaks from 
            the code into consideration. 

            This is without using any br tags.
