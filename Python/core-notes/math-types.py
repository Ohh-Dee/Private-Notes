#import math
x = 3.14
y = 4
z = 5

#result = round(x) it will round down to the nearest whole integer
# result = abs() will give you the absoulute value of an itema
#result = pow(x, 3) will use the exponent with the first value being the base number and the second being what power you are rasing it to. 
#result  = max(x, y, z) will give you the max value between all these values
#result = min(x, y, z) give min

#result = math.pi EX print(math.pi) gives pi
#result = math.sqrt(25) givesf you the square root
#result = math.ceil(9.1) will always round up this will = 10
#result = math.floor(9.9) will always round down this will = 9
