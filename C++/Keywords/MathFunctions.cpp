#include <iostream>

int main(){

double x = 3;
double y = 4;
double z;
// Both of these functions do not require #include <cmath>
// z = std::max(x, y); This will compare the two values and assign z with the max (highest)
// z = std::min(x, y); This will compare the two values and assign z with the min (lowest)

// z = pow(2, 3); This will raise the fisrt number (2), to the power of the second (3).
// z = sqrt(9); This will give you the square root of a number.
// z = abs(-5); This will give you the ABSOLUTE VALUE number in this example of -5 which is 5. This is the distance between the number and 0.
// z = round(x); This would round a number
// z = ceil(x): This would round up a number
// z = floor(x); x rounded down = 3
